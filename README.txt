The template for practicing html css is taken from the site
https://www.figma.com/file/3QYe413SHr9nD7dEM6TGvn/SLAB-SHOT-Datawarehouse-Freebie?node-id=413%3A3

Paid fonts have been replaced.
The dimensions are adjusted by multiples of 5 (If it was possible).
The figma template doesn't match the bootstrap columns in some places.
